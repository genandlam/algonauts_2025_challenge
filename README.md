## The 2025 challenge

Encoding models of neural responses are increasingly used as predictive and explanatory tools in computational neuroscience ([Kay et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06713); [Kell et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.03.044); [Kriegeskorte and Douglas, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2019.04.002); [Naselaris et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.073); [Tuckute et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002366); [Van Gerven, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2016.06.009); [Wu et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.neuro.29.051605.113024); [Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4244)). They consist of algorithms, typically based on deep learning architectures, that take stimuli as input, and output the corresponding neural activations, effectively modeling how the brain responds to (i.e., encodes) these stimuli. Thus, the goal of the 2025 challenge is to provide a platform for biological and artificial intelligence scientists to cooperate and compete in developing cutting-edge functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) encoding models. Specifically, these models should predict fMRI response to multimodal naturalistic movies, and generalize outside their training distribution.
The challenge is based on data from the Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling ([CNeuroMod](https://www.cneuromod.ca/)), which has acquired the dataset that, to date, most intensively samples single-subject fMRI responses to a variety of naturalistic tasks, including movie watching.
